Dream Housing Finance aims to automate loan approval using machine learning. This project predicts loan eligibility based on customer details like income, credit history, and loan amount.
The process includes data preprocessing and training models such as Voting Classifier, Bagging, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost and LightGBM for optimal results. Built with Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn, future improvements may include feature engineering and web deployment.
